# pico-gameblock
Trying out the Pico features....


I have a Pico Lipo along with a Pico Unicorn as the game playing surface.

Going to first try writing a quick battery powered set of games to play
on it. Then once I'm familiar with the hardware and code, try Mecrisp Forth.

This project will be the playground before I work on my bottle filler 
project with this hardward and quite possibly Mecrisp Forth.
